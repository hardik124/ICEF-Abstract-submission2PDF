South Asia is home to around one-fourth of mankind and houses the largest proportion of undernourished people in the world. Despite a period of marked economic growth averaging 6% a year over the past two decades, it remains the world's second poorest region contributing a mere 2.2% in global annual GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of South Asian economy employing around 60% of the total workforce and generating around 20% of total GDP. South Asia has the recognition of being the second most food-insecure region next only to sub-Saharan Africa. Though there is growing evidence that technological innovation has a key role to play in increasing agricultural production and strengthening food security, agricultural research and development (R&D) sector has failed to garner sufficient attention till now. This study also depicts the current situation of food security in South Asia and illustrates how agricultural education and innovation hold the master key to solve the food security issues for the world's most densely populated region.","Research and Development, food security, education, innovation, populated region.","Q1, Q2,Q3,Q4,Q5.","Head & Associate Professor in Economics, P.G.Courses & Research Centre, D.N.R.COLLEGE(Andhra University-1945), City:BHIMAVARAM-534 202, State: Andhra Pradesh, Country: INDIA"
